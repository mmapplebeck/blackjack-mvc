Intro
-----
Blackjack MVC is a small game I created as a side project to learn [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). Enjoy!

How To Play
-----------
Download the project and open index.html.

Compatibility
-------------
Recent versions of Chrome and Safari (for CSS transformations)

Future Considerations
---------------------
* Asynchronous loading of modules and dependencies using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
* Behavior-driven testing using [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) or similar framework
* Side rules (double down, splitting, insurance, surrendering, etc.)
* Sounds (card flips, chip clinks, etc.)
* Saving chip total in local storage
* Tracking wins/losses/ties

Credits
-------
* CSS playing cards heavily influenced by Don Park's [scalable CSS playing cards](https://github.com/donpark/scalable-css-playing-cards)
* Card flip animation technique by [David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/css-flip)
* Playing table texture generated by [noisetexturegenerator.com](http://www.noisetexturegenerator.com/)
